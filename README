DESCRIPTION
    This module takes advantage of the extensive xmlrpc interface provided
    by public Bookmarks servers and allows registered users to interact with
    the site just as they would normally.

    The Bookmarks XMLRPC API dicates that all user based functionality
    requires an authkey provided by the server during the login call. In the
    METHODS section each item will state if it requires an authkey.

  NOTE
    This is a beta version of the module with very few of the API functions
    implimented. Please make note of this for future releases.

METHODS
    new This function instantiates a WWW::Bookmarks object. The arguments
        that can be passed are limited to server.

        authkey is required.
